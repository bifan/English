## Jonathan Livingston Seagull - Part 4

For a few years, after Jonathan Seagull vanished from the beaches of the Flock, it was the strangest bunch of birds that had ever lived on earth. Many of them had actually begun to understand the message he had brought, and it was as common to see a young gull flying upside-down and practicing loops as it was to see an old one, unwilling to open his eyes to the glory of flying, boring straight and level out to the fishing boats, hoping for a supper of soggy bread.

strangest /ˈstreɪndʒɪst/ 奇怪的 - unwilling /ʌnˈwɪlɪŋ/ 不愿意的 - supper /ˈsʌpər/ 晚饭 - soggy /ˈsɒɡi/ 湿透的

海鸥乔纳森离开海滩已经好多年了。现在，那里生活着一群地球上最奇怪的海鸥。许多海鸥刚开始领悟乔纳森说过的话。他们上下翻飞、翻着筋斗，这种练习场景几乎与老海鸥们的生存方式一样常见 他们仍旧对那些荣耀的飞行熟视无睹，重复着单调的直线，平直地飞向渔船，只为获得一些湿面包渣。

Fletcher Lynd Seagull and the other students of Jonathan spread their instructor’s teaching of freedom and flight in long missionary journeys to every flock on the Coastline.

福来奇• 林德和乔纳森的其他学生在漫长的教学过程中，向海岸线上的每一群海鸥传授着关于自由和飞行的信条。

There were remarkable events in those days. Fletcher’s own students, and students of their students, were flying with precision and a kind of joy that had never been seen before. Here and there were individual birds who flew aerobatics as they practiced, better than Fletcher, sometimes better even than Jonathan himself had flown them. The learning curve of a highly motivated seagull goes on steeply off the top of any graph, and now and then there were students who overcame limits so perfectly that they disappeared, as Jonathan had, from the face of an earth too limited to contain them.

precision /prɪˈsɪʒən/ 精确 - individual /ˌɪndɪˈvɪdʒuəl/ 个别的 - aerobatics /ˌeərəˈbætɪks/ 特技飞行 - motivated /ˈmoʊtɪveɪtɪd/ 有动机的

那段日子界发生了很多大事。福来奇的一代代学生都享受着精确飞行带来的前所未有的快乐。有的海鸥在练习特技动作时超越了福来奇，有的甚至比乔纳森做得还好。一只极为积极的海鸥的学习进程达到了最高的层次，如同乔纳森做到的一样，他脱离了有限的地球表面，飞向了更为高远的地方。

It was a golden age, for a while. Crowds of gulls elbowed in upon Fletcher, to touch the one who had touched Jonathan Seagull, a bird they now considered divine. In vain did Fletcher insist that Jonathan had been a gull like them all, who had learned as they all could learn. They were after him constantly to hear Jonathan’s exact words, his precise gestures, to find tiny details about him. The more they begged for trivia, the more uneasy grew Fletcher Gull. When once they had been interested in practicing the message . . . training and flying fast and free and glorious in the sky . . . now they began to slack away from difficult work, and became ever so slightly wild-eyed over legends of Jonathan, as though he were the idol of a fan club.

那真是一段金子般绚烂的日子。成群的海鸥亲呢地靠在福来奇身上，只为抚摸这只被乔纳森亲自指导过的海鸥，在他们的心中，这是一件如此神圣的事。尽管福来奇不断地告诉他们，乔纳森也只是一只平凡的海鸥，他所学的一切都已经教给他们了，但他们仍旧日夜跟着福来奇，想听到乔纳森说过的只言片语，或是学到他精确的姿势，不肯放过任何细节。他们越来越执着于细节，这让福来奇十分不安。他们感兴趣的曾经是乔纳森的飞行思想，他的训练技巧、完美的速度以及在空中自由翱翔时的荣耀。如今，他们似乎从这项艰苦工作中解放了出来，沉醉于乔纳森的传奇之中，仅仅把他当成了偶像。

“Gull Fletcher,” they asked, “did the Magnificent Jonathan say, ‘We are in truth the ideas of the Great Gull . . .’ or was it, ‘We are in fact the ideas of the Great Gull . . .’?”

“福来奇大鸥，”他们问道，“伟大的乔纳森曾经说的那句名言是“我们其实是伟大的化身’还是‘我们的确是伟大的化身’？”

“Please. Call me Fletcher. Just Fletcher Seagull,” he would reply, appalled that they would use a term of reverence upon him. “And what difference does it make, which word he used? Both are correct, we are ideas of the Great Gull . . .” But he knew they were not satisfied with his answer, they thought he had dodged their question.

“请叫我福来奇吧，我只是普通的海鸥。”他回答道，惊异于他们居然用这样的称呼来标榜自己，“他具体用哪个词有什么重要的呢？两个词是一个意思，都表达了‘我们是伟大的化身’这个道理⋯”但是他知道，海鸥们对这个回答很不满意，他们认为这只是在逃避问题。

“Gull Fletcher, when the Divine Gull Jonathan rose to fly, did he move one step toward the wind . . . or two?” Before he could correct the one question, another was fired. “Gull Fletcher, did the Sacred Gull Jonathan have gray eyes or golden eyes?” The questioner, a bird with gray eyes, was in anguish for one answer only.

“大鸥福来奇，当神圣的大鸥乔纳森准备飞翔时，他是向前迈出一步，还是两步？”没等他提出这个问题的荒谬之处，另一个问题又接踵而至。“大鸥福来奇，伟大的大鸥乔纳森的眼睛是灰色的还是金色的？”提问者是一只灰色眼睛的海鸥，他急切地想知道这个问题的答案。

“I don’t know! Forget his eyes! He had . . . purple eyes! How can that matter? What he came to tell us was that we can fly, if we would just wake up and stop standing around on the beach talking about the color of somebody’s eyes! Now watch, and I’ll show you a Pinwheel Turn . . .”

“我不知道！忽略这无聊的关于眼睛颜色的问题吧！他的眼睛是⋯⋯紫色的！这有什么重要的？
他想告诉我们的，只是我们能像他那样飞翔，所以，我们不应该一醒来就站在这里，讨论什么眼睛的颜色了。现在，请大家集中注意力，我来给大家示范快速旋转……

But more than one gull, finding it wearying to practice something as difficult as a Pinwheel, flew home musing, “The Great One had purple eyes—not like my eyes, not like the eyes of any gull that ever lived.”

海鸥们发现快速旋转的雄度太高了，便纷纷飞回了察，还一边沉思：“伟大的乔纳森拥有紫色的眼晴和我的不一样，和我见过的所有海鸥都不
一样。”

The classes changed, with years, from wide soaring poems in flight to hushed talk about Jonathan before and after practice; to long involved recitations on the sand about the Divine One, with no flying ever done by anybody.

一年又一年过去，课程的性质逐渐改变了，开始是在飞行中歌颂乔纳森，之后是飞行练习前后对他的悄声读论，最后变成了站在沙滩上日复一日地背诵乔纳森的种种事迹。最终，飞行练习已不复存在。

Fletcher and the other students of Jonathan were at turns puzzled and correctful and firm and furious at the change, but they were helpless to stop it. They were honored, and worse—revered, but they were no longer heard, and the birds who practiced flying were fewer and fewer.

福来奇和乔纳森的其他学生对这种变化时而困惑，时而恼怒，时而坚定地力求改变，但又无能为力。
他们被给予了更多的荣誉，却越来越不受尊敬，失去了话语权。练习飞行的海鸥变得越来越少。

One by one the Original Students passed away, leaving cold dead bodies behind them.

这批学生一个接一个地去世，只留下冰冷的尸体。

The Flock, seizing upon the bodies, held great tearful ceremonies over them, burying them under enormous cairns of pebbles; each pebble laid in place after a long sorrowing sermon by a deadly solemn bird. The cairns became shrines, and it was required ritual for every gull who wished Oneness to drop a pebble and a doleful speech upon the cairn. No one knew what Oneness was, but it was such a serious deep thing that a gull could never ask without being thought a fool. Why, everybody knows what Oneness is, and the prettier the pebble you drop on Gull Martin's tomb, the better your chance of getting there.

鸥群抬起尸体，为他们举行了盛大的悼念仪式，海鸥们的泪水洒满了大地，令人动容。他们将这些海鸥埋在巨大的卵石坑里，每一块卵石都是悲痛的鸟儿长久地哀悼之后安放的。这个石冢变成了一处圣地。对于任何一只想与万物合一的海鸥来说，在这里放一块卵石并念上一段悼词都是必要的仪式。
谁也不知道万物合一究竟是什么意思，它如此深奥，任何海鸥都不会问及这个问题，没有谁想当傻瓜。为什么呢？因为他们觉得所有海鸥都知道这是什么意思，放在大鸥马丁坟墓上的卵石越漂亮，就越有机会到达这个境界。

Fletcher passed away last of all. It happened during a long lonely session of the purest and most beautiful flying he had ever done. His body vanished in the midst of a long vertical slow roll, something he had practiced since he first met Jonathan Seagull, and when he vanished he was not setting pebbles or meditating over slogans of Oneness. He was lost in the perfection of his own flight.

最后，福来奇也去世了，事情发生在一次独自飞行中，那是他最纯粹、最美丽的飞行。他的身体消失在一段长长的垂直慢速侧翻中，那是他第一次见到海鸥乔纳森时所做的练习。他消失后，没有卵石做成的坟墓，也没有为了践行万物合一而进行的沉思。他消失在了这次完美的飞行中。

When Fletcher didn't show up on the beach in the next week, when he vanished without leaving a note, the Flock was in brief consternation.

下周到来时，福来奇没有出现在海滩上。没有留下只言片语，他就这样消失了。鸥群慌乱起来。

But then they gathered together, and thought, and decided what must have happened. It was announced that Gull Fletcher had been seen, surrounded by the other Seven First Students, standing on what would henceforth be known as the Rock of Oneness, and then the clouds had parted and the Great Gull Jonathan Livingston Seagull himself, clad in royal plumes and golden shells, with a crown of precious pebbles upon his brow, pointing symbolically to sky and sea and wind and earth, had called him up to the Beach of Oneness and Fletcher had magically risen, surrounded by holy rays, and the clouds had closed again over the scene to a great chorus of gull-voices singing.

他们聚到一起，开始思考发生了什么事。有海鸥说他们看到福来奇和他七位最初的学生站在一块石头上，这块石头今后将被称为“合一石”。之后.
云层突然散开，伟大的海鸥乔纳森出现了，他有象征着荣耀的羽毛，佩戴着金色的贝壳，额头上悬曲着一颗珍贵的鹅卵石皇冠，象征着天空、海洋、风和大地。他召唤着“合一石”上的海鸥，这时，福来奇奇迹般地升了起来，周身围绕着圣洁的光芒，在海鸥们合唱的圣歌中，云层渐渐合上。

And so the pile of pebbles on the Rock of Oneness, in sacred memory of Gull Fletcher, was the biggest pile of pebbles on any coastline anywhere on earth. Other piles were built everywhere in replica, and each Tuesday afternoon the Flock walked over to stand around the pebbles and hear the miracles of Jonathan Livingston Seagull and his Gifted Divine Students. Nobody did any more flying than was absolutely necessary, and when it was necessary they grew strange customs about it. As a kind of status symbol, the more affluent birds began carrying branches from trees in their beaks. The larger and heavier the branch a gull carried, the more attention he earned in the Flock. The larger the branch, the more progressive a flyer he was considered.

为了纪念福来奇、“合一石”上的卵石越来越多，成了这个地球海岸线上卵石数量最多的石堆。许多地方都建起了“合一石”的复制品，每周二的下午，海鸥们都围绕在卵石堆旁，倾听海鸥乔纳森和他那些神圣学生的传说。没有一只海鸥进行过必要的飞行之外的练习，此外，他们还衍生出了一种奇的习惯。更富裕的鸟儿会在飞行时用喙衔着树枝作为种身份的象征。树枝越大越重，他们便会得到越多的鸟群的注意，也越会被认为是前卫的飞行者。

A few in gull society noticed that by carrying the weight and drag of the branches around with them, the most faithful seagulls became disturbing flyers.

渐渐地，有些海鸥开始意识到，那些钛着地衔着树枝的鸟儿，因为树枝的重量和拖拽产生的阻力，成了鸥群中阻碍飞行的存在。

The symbol for Jonathan's teaching became a smooth pebble. Then later, any old rock would do. It was the worst possible symbol for a bird who had come to teach the joy of flight, but nobody seemed to notice. At least, nobody who mattered in the Flock.

光滑的鹅卵石成了乔纳森过往的教学的象征，渐渐地却被老旧的硬石头取代了。对为激发飞翔的乐趣而教导飞行的海鸥来说，这无疑是最坏的象征，但是没有人注意到这些，毕竟现在的鸥群中，已经没有谁是举足轻重的了。

On Tuesdays all flying stopped and a listless crowd gathered to stand and hear the Official Flock Student recite. In a matter of only a few years the recitations stratified and hardened into granite dogma. "Ho-Jonathak-Gullak-Great Gullak-Oneak-have-pity-on-we-who-are-lower-than-sandfleas.." On and on, for hours, come Tuesday. It was a mark of excellence for the Official to run the sounds together rapid fire, so they couldn't be recognized as words at all. A few insolent birds whispered that the sound meant nothing anyway, even if one could eventually figure out that there was in fact a word or two buried within it.

星期二的例行飞行取消了，变成了一群无精打采的海鸥的聚会，内容是一些程式化的朗诵。仅仅几年后，这些朗诵就成了如同花岗岩一般死板的经文。“神圣的乔纳森大鸥深切地同情比沙中的跳蚤还卑下的生灵…”一遍又一遍，这样的内容会在每周二持续好几个小时。那些“正经学生”把快速地朗诵视为杰出的象征，根本没有海鸥能听清其中的字句。一些傲慢的鸟儿窃窃私语：即使能从中依稀分辨出几个词，但从整体上来说，这些话没有任何意义。

Images of Jonathan, pecked from sand-stone, set with great sad purple-shell eyes, sprung up all along the coastline, at every cairn and replica cairn, centers to a worship heavier even than rocks could symbolize.

乔纳森的形象出现在砂石上，他那犹如紫贝壳般的哀伤的眼睛，突然出现在海岸线所有的石堆上，比任何一块代表其形象的石头都更加沉重。

In less than two hundred years nearly every element of Jonathan's teaching was taken out of daily practice by the simple pronouncement that it was Holy, and beyond the aspiration of common gulls, lower-than-sandfleas. In time, the rites and ceremonies that were planted around the name of Jonathan Seagull became obsessive. Any thinking gull altered course in the air so as not to even fly in sight of the cairns, built as they were on the ceremony and superstition of those who preferred excuses for failure instead of hard work and greatness.

不到两百年的时间，乔纳森的飞行思想就被短短的几行经文代替了，那句话是：神圣的主啊，没能超越平庸思想的海鸥，将比沙中的跳蚤还要卑下。
随着时间的推移，围绕着海鸥乔纳森的仪式越来越荒谬，越来越狂热。有想法的海鸥们将课程转移到了天上，甚至不想出现在能看到石堆的地方。
那些为了仪式和迷信建石堆的海鸥宁愿在修建失败后找各种理由，也不愿认真工作，更不愿感念他的伟大。

The thinking gulls, paradoxically, closed their minds at the sound of certain words: "Flight," "Cairn," "Great Gull," "Jonathan." On all other matters they were the most lucid, honest birds since Jonathan himself, but at the mention of his name, or any of the other terms so badly mauled by the Official Local Students, their minds snapped shut with the sound of trap doors closing.

矛盾的是，有思想的海鸥们根本不愿听到“飞翔”“石堆”“伟大的海鸥”“乔纳森”这些词，却正表明他们是自乔纳森以来最清醒、最诚实的鸟儿。
只要一听到乔纳森的名字，或是听到那些所谓的“正经学生”的陈词滥调，这些明智的鸟儿便会马上锁上心门。

Because they were curious, they began experimenting with flight, though they never used that word. "It's not flight," they'd assure themselves over and again, "It's just a way of finding what's true." So, in rejecting the "Students" they became students themselves. In rejecting the name of Jonathan Seagull, they practiced the message he had brought to the Flock.

因为好奇，这些海鸥开始尝试“飞翔”，尽管之前他们从未用过这个词。“这不是‘飞翔’，”他们一遍又一遍地强调，“只是一种寻找真理的方式而已。”所以，尽管他们拒绝承认自己是乔纳森的学生，却成了他真正的学生；他们拒绝盲目崇拜海鸥乔纳森，无形中却按照乔纳森的方法进行着练习。

This was no noisy revolution; there was no shouting, no waving of banners. But individuals like Anthony Seagull, for instance, not fully grown into the feathers of adulthood, began asking questions.

这不是一场喧嚣的革命，没有呐喊，也没有挥动旗帜。但是像安东尼这样羽翼未丰的小海鸥，却开始提出一些问题。

"Now look," he had told his Official Local Student, "the birds who come to hear you every Tuesday come for three reasons, don't they? Because they think they're learning something; because they think that putting another pebble on the Cairn is going to make them holy; or because everybody else expects them to be there. Right?"

他向一个“正经学生”提问道：“你看，他们每周二都会来这儿听你讲课，无非出于三个原因或是认为可以学到什么，或是他们觉得在石堆上多放一块石头会让他们变得神圣，或是因为别的海鸥期待他们能来，你觉得呢？”

"And you have nothing to learn, my nestling?"
“难道你什么都没学到吗，小家伙？”

"No. There's something to learn, but I don't know what it is. A million pebbles can't make me holy if I don't deserve it, and I don't care what the other gulls think about me."

“不。我知道这里肯定有什么是值得我学习的，但我不知道那是什么。一百万颗卵石不会让我变神圣，可能我不配得到它。而且我也不在乎别的海鸥是怎么看待我的。”

"And what is your answer, nestling?" ever so slightly shaken by this heresy. "How do you call the miracle of life? The Great-Gull-Jona-than-Holy-Be-His-Name said that flight.."

“那你的答案呢，小家伙？”他知道以前也有这样的异端邪说出现过，“你认为什么是生命的伟大奇迹？以伟大的海鸥乔纳森之名，他说飞翔…”

"Life isn't a miracle, Official, it's a bore. Your Great Gull Jonathan is a myth somebody made up a long time ago, a fairy tale that the weak believe because they can't stand to face the world as it is. Imagine! A seagull who could fly two hundred miles per hour! I've tried it, and the fastest I can go is fifty, diving, and even then I'm mostly out of control. There are laws of flight that cannot be broken, and if you don't think so, you go out there and try it! Do you honestly believe-truly, now-that your great Jonathan Seagull flew two hundred miles per hour?"

“生命中没有奇迹，长官，只有无尽的无聊。
你说的伟大的海鸥乔纳森只是很久以前编造出来的神话，弱者才会相信神话，因为他们无法面对这个真实的世界！你居然说一只海鸥可以达到二百英里每小时的飞行速度！我试过了，我能达到的最快速度就是五十英里每小时，即使这样，我都要失去控制了。有些飞行规律是不可能打破的，如果你不这么想，那就去展示给我看！说实话，你真的相信此时此刻，扪心自问——你伟大的海鸥乔纳森会达到二百英里每小时的飞行速度？”

"And faster," the Official said in perfect blind faith. "And taught others to do so."

“我相信他比这个速度还要快，”长官对乔纳森的信仰十分盲目，“而且他教授给了很多海鸥这个技巧。”

"So goes your fairy tale. But when you can show me that you can fly that fast, Official, then I'll begin listening to what you have to say."

“去你的神话吧，长官。除非亲眼所见，我是不会相信你说的话的。”

There was the key and Anthony Seagull knew it the instant he said the words. He didn't have answers, but he knew that he would gratefully, gladly lay down his life to follow any bird who could demonstrate what he was talking about, show him just a few answers in life that worked, that brought excellence and joy into everyday living. Until he found that bird, life would remain gray and bleak, illogical, without purpose; every seagull would remain a coincidental collection of blood and feathers pointed toward oblivion.

在说出这些话的瞬间，海鸥安东尼便领悟了获得答案的关键。他现在还没有答案，但是他知道自已十分乐意跟在能证明这个事实的海鸥后面，并且心怀感激。他期待有谁能解答生命中的一些疑惑，并将美好和光荣带人每天的生活。在找到这只海鸥之前，或许生命会一如既往地晦暗、凄凉、没有章法、毫无目标。每一只平凡的海鸥都只是血和羽毛的偶然结合，注定会被遗忘。

Anthony Seagull went his own way, as did more and more other young birds, rejecting the ritual and ceremony that encrusted the name of Jonathan Seagull, sad at the futility of life but at least honest with themselves, brave enough to face the fact that it was futile.

海鸥安东尼决定走自己的路，有越来越多的海鸥和安东尼的想法样，拒绝接受纪念海鸥乔纳森的任何仪式。他们为人生的无意义感到悲伤，但是至少能诚实地面对自己，接受人生并没有意义的事实。

Then one afternoon Anthony was flapping along above the sea, thinking blankly that life is pointless and since pointless is by definition meaningless then the only proper act is to dive down into the ocean and drown. Better not to exist at all than to exist like a seaweed, without meaning or joy.

一天下午，安东尼在海上拍打着翅膀，思考着这没有目标的人生，没有目标意味着没有意义，那最恰当的生存方式可能就是潜入海中淹死。与其像一棵海草一样生活，不如选择消失在这个世界上，毕竟这样的生活既没有欢愉也没有意义。

It all made sense. It was pure logic, and Anthony Seagull had all his life tried to abide by honesty and logic. He had to die sooner or later anyway, and he saw no reason to prolong the painful boredom of living.

万物存在即合理。这是纯粹的逻辑，海鸥安东尼的一生都力求诚实，讲究逻辑。他觉得，既然终有一死，那么就没有刻意延长这平淡无聊的生活的理由了。

So he pushed over, from two thousand feet, into a dive straight toward the water, coming down at nearly fifty miles per hour. It was oddly exhilarating, to have made the decision at last. He had found the one answer that made any sense at all.

于是他从两千英尺高的地方坠落，达到了五十五英里每小时的速度。这最终的决定生出了奇异的兴奋感。他终于找到了合理的答案。
他逐渐下坠，海平面倾斜了，在他面前渐渐放大。

Along about midway into his death-dive, with the sea tilting and growing huge beneath him, there was a great whistling roar directly past his right wing and he was passed in flight by another seagull... passed as though he had been standing on the beach. The other bird was a white streak blazing down, a blurred meteor from space. Anthony, startled, bent his wings into dive-brakes and wondered helplessly at the sight.

在这自杀式坠落的途中，他突然听到了一声震耳欲聋的呼啸声，一只鸟快速飞过他的右侧，好似一道闪电⋯⋯那一瞬间，安东尼感觉自己就像静止地站在沙滩上，而旁边急速飞过一只鸟儿似的。这只鸟有白色的条纹，在天空中划过时犹如一颗模糊的流星。安东尼震惊了，弯曲着翅膀试图减速，他看着眼前的景象，感到十分无助。

The blur dwindled softly toward the sea, flashing down at the wave tops, and then bent into a hard pullup, beak pointing right straight back up into the sky, and rolled. A long vertical slow roll, twisting off into an impossible full circle in the air.

这道模糊的闪电在海面上减了速，平滑地越过海平面上涌起的波涛。接着，他猛地飞上天，喙笔直朝上，无所畏惧，然后在天空中转了一个圈。这是一个长长的垂直慢速侧翻，在空气中形成了一个不可能形成的完整的圆圈。

Anthony stalled, watching; forgot where he was, stalled again. "I swear," he said out loud, "I swear that was a seagull!" He turned at once toward the other bird, who apparently hadn't noticed him. "HEY!" he called, as loud as he could. "HEY! WAIT UP!"

安东尼愣住了，呆呆地望着眼前的景象，忘记了自己身处何方。“我发誓，”他大声说道，“我发誓我看到了一只海鸥！”他立即调头追赶这只鸟，显然，这只鸟并没有注意到安东尼。“嘿！”他用最大的声音呼喊着，“嘿！等下我！”

The gull pitched immediately up on one wing, moving at tremendous speed, blazed back toward him. Anthony in level flight, pulled hard into a vertical bank, and stopped suddenly in the air, as a racing-skier stops at the end of a downhill run.

这只海鸥立即扇动着一只翅膀猛冲过来，速度惊人，一瞬间，这道光芒冲向了他。安东尼此时正水平飞行，他拼命正直向上飞，却仍旧倾斜着，很快停在了空中，犹如滑雪者停在下坡路的尽头。

"Hey!" Anthony was all out of breath. "What... what are you doing?" It was a silly question, but he didn't know what else to say.

“嘿！”安东尼已经上气不接下气了，“你在……你在干什么？”这是一个很傻的问题，但是他不知道该问些什么。

"I'm sorry if I startled you," the stranger said in a voice as clear and friendly as the wind. "I had you in sight all the time. Just playing... I wouldn't have hit you."

“如果我吓到你了，那么很抱歉。”这只陌生海鸥的声音清晰而友好，让安东尼如沐春风，“我一直在观察你。刚才只是在玩复…⋯我不是想攻击你。

"No! No, that's not it." Anthony was awake and alive for the first time in his life, inspired. "What was that?"

“不，不，我不是想问这个。”安东尼仿佛第一次体验到活着的感觉，觉得备受鼓舞，“你刚刚展现的是什么？”

"Oh, some fun-flying, I guess. A dive and a pullup to a slow roll with a rolling loop off the top. Just messing around. If you really want to do it well it takes a bit of practice, but it's a nice-looking thing, don't you think?"

“噢，那是一些有趣的飞行技巧。一个俯冲、一个直升和一次缓慢的慢速侧翻。这只是出于兴趣。如果你真的想把它们做好，需要一些练习，但做起来确实很漂亮，你认为呢？”

"It's, it's ... beautiful, is what it is! But you haven't been around the Flock at all. Who are you, anyway?"

“它们、它们…⋯很漂亮，确实很漂亮！但是你从来没有出现在鸥群中。你究竟是谁？”

"You can call me Jon."

“你可以叫我乔。”
